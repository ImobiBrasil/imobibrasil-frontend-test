# ImobiBrasil Landing Page V1 - Static Version

## Overview
This is a standalone static version of the ImobiBrasil Landing Page V1, converted from the original React application with advanced components to run directly in web browsers without requiring Node.js, build tools, or a development server.

## Original Project
- **Source**: landing-page-imobi-em-v1
- **Technology**: React 19 with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and CRACO
- **Build System**: CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)
- **UI Components**: Extensive use of Radix UI primitives and modern React patterns

## Conversion Process
1. **Resolved dependency conflicts** using `--legacy-peer-deps`
2. **Fixed build issues** by installing compatible ajv version
3. **Built the React project** using `npm run build` with CRACO
4. **Extracted static assets** from the build directory
5. **Fixed file paths** from absolute (`/static/...`) to relative (`./static/...`)
6. **Cleaned up metadata** and removed tracking scripts
7. **Maintained all functionality** including complex UI components

## Features Preserved

- ✅ **Accessibility**: Radix UI accessibility features maintained
- ✅ **React 19 Features**: Latest React hooks and patterns preserved

## Technical Complexity
This version includes advanced features:
- **Radix UI Components**: 20+ advanced UI primitives
- **CRACO Build System**: Custom webpack configuration
- **React 19**: Latest React features and concurrent rendering
- **Complex Dependencies**: Multiple UI libraries and utilities
- **Form Handling**: Advanced form validation and state management
- **Modern Patterns**: Hooks, context, and advanced React patterns
