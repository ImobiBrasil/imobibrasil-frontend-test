# ImobiBrasil Landing Page V2 - Static Version

## Overview
This is a standalone static version of the ImobiBrasil Landing Page V2, converted from the original React application with advanced components to run directly in web browsers without requiring Node.js, build tools, or a development server.

## Original Project
- **Source**: landing-page-imobi-em-v2
- **Technology**: React 19 with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and CRACO
- **Build System**: CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override)
- **UI Components**: Extensive use of Radix UI primitives

## Conversion Process
1. **Resolved dependency conflicts** using `--legacy-peer-deps`
2. **Fixed build issues** by installing compatible ajv version
3. **Built the React project** using `npm run build` with CRACO
4. **Extracted static assets** from the build directory
5. **Fixed file paths** from absolute (`/static/...`) to relative (`./static/...`)
6. **Cleaned up metadata** and removed tracking scripts
7. **Maintained all functionality** including complex UI components

## Features Preserved
- ✅ **Advanced UI Components**: Radix UI components compiled to vanilla JavaScript
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Interactive Elements**: Form handling, modals, dropdowns, tooltips
- ✅ **Modern Animations**: CSS transitions and Tailwind animations
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Modular component structure preserved in bundle
- ✅ **Professional Styling**: Advanced styling with CSS-in-JS compiled
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Radix UI accessibility features maintained

## Technical Complexity
This version was significantly more complex than V3 due to:
- **Radix UI Components**: 20+ advanced UI primitives
- **CRACO Build System**: Custom webpack configuration
- **React 19**: Latest React features and hooks
- **Complex Dependencies**: Multiple UI libraries and utilities
- **Form Handling**: Advanced form validation and state management

## File Structure

```

## Bundle Size
- **JavaScript**: 143.24 KB (gzipped) - Larger due to Radix UI components
- **CSS**: 11.58 KB (gzipped) - Includes Tailwind and component styles
- **Total**: ~155 KB - Reasonable for the feature set included

## How to Use

### ⚠️ Important: React Router Requirement
This version uses React Router and **requires a local HTTP server** to work properly. Opening `index.html` directly in a browser will show a blank page due to routing conflicts.

### Recommended Methods (Choose One):

#### 1. **Use Included Server Scripts** (Easiest)
- **Windows**: Double-click `start-server.bat`
- **Mac/Linux**: Run `chmod +x start-server.sh && ./start-server.sh`
- Open browser to `http://localhost:8001`

#### 2. **Manual Server Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd landing-page-imobi-em-v2-static

# Start Python HTTP server
python -m http.server 8001

# Open browser to http://localhost:8001
```

#### 3. **Alternative Servers**
- **Node.js**: `npx serve . -p 8001`
- **PHP**: `php -S localhost:8001`
- **Live Server** (VS Code extension)

#### 4. **Web Hosting**
Upload all files to any web hosting service (works perfectly on servers)

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers
- ⚠️ IE11 not supported (due to modern React features)

## Key Differences from Original
- **No Node.js required**: Runs with simple HTTP server (not direct file access)
- **No build process**: Pre-compiled and ready to use
- **Relative paths**: All assets use relative paths for portability
- **Self-contained**: All Radix UI and dependencies bundled
- **Removed tracking**: Cleaned up analytics and external badges
- **Router Dependency**: Requires HTTP server due to React Router usage

## Component Features Included
- Advanced form components with validation
- Modal dialogs and overlays
- Dropdown menus and select components

## Deployment
This static version can be deployed to:
- GitHub Pages

- Any static hosting service
- Local file system

## Build Challenges Resolved
- ✅ Dependency version conflicts (date-fns vs react-day-picker)
- ✅ AJV module resolution issues
- ✅ CRACO build configuration compatibility
- ✅ Babel plugin deprecation warnings
- ✅ Legacy peer dependency resolution
